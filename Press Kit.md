# _Press Kit_
## Counter Attacker

Welcome to our game! Our game is a 2D platform game that is inspired by classic games such as _Contra_ and _Super Mario Bros_. While brainstorming, we had the idea to implement the Block/Reflect design from the _Dark Souls_ series and the _Sekiro:Shadows Die Twice_. We then combined these elements to form our own game.
